Hello Allen,

In these unpresidented times, we are hoping that you and
your colleagues at the Northwind Trading Co are taking every 
precaution to stay safe.

We, at Expert 23, have swung our focus to the next
challenge our Nation faces: the restart of our economy.

Our company is a wholesale provider of B2B HQL leads and other
customer acquistion solutions (webinars, video channels, etc).

Our client list consists of a wide universe of companies. 
We continue to work at full pace finding customers, 
for firms like yours, who are ready to buy.

While you focus on keeping your team safe, and dealing with all
of the new challenges we face, please allow us to help you keep
your market share and customer acquisition pipeline healthy, as well.

Attached is an introduction to our firm. We would appreciate an
opportunity to discuss this with you, at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
